         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THo the <hi>Sons of Our Church</hi> ſeem of late ſomewhat out of Humour as to the Buſineſs of <hi>Addreſsing,</hi> yet the Obligations You have laid upon Us, cannot but vanquiſh the moſt Obſtinate. 'Tis true, ſcarce any of Us could find in our Hearts to <hi>Thank the King</hi> at all, for the Greateſt and moſt <hi>Gracious Favour</hi> that ever Prince did or could Vouchſafe to <hi>Subjects;</hi> And thoſe <hi>Few</hi> that pretend to do it, have proceeded ſo <hi>Awkwardly</hi> in their Acknowledgments, as renders them of very little Value: For to Thank His Majeſty not Abſolutely for the <hi>Main Scope</hi> of His <hi>Healing Declaration,</hi> but only for one <hi>Single Expreſſion</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, relating to our own immediate Intereſt and Temporal Advantages; and at the ſame time to preſs the continuance of thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> which diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both the <hi>Royal Indulgence,</hi> and that Generous, Univerſal, and moſt <hi>Chriſtian Principle</hi> upon which it is grounded, is apt to be conſtrued not only a groſs <hi>Defect of Charity</hi> (as if we regarded no bodies Eaſe and Happineſs but our <hi>Own,</hi> and minded our <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> above all other Conſiderations) but alſo diſcovers a deep-rooted Averſion to the <hi>Toleration</hi> it ſelf, a tacite Reflection on His Majeſties <hi>Proceedings,</hi> and a violent Inclination to be <hi>Paſhing</hi> and <hi>Goring, Rending</hi> and <hi>Tearing,</hi> as fiercely as formerly, if ever we can get the opportunity: And what is all this (will our Enemies ſay) but to Upbraid and Affront the King, whilſt we ſeem to Complement Him?</p>
            <p>But whatever Cauſe His Majeſty may have to Reſent this Shuffling Conduct, You, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſhall not fail of our Sincere Reſpects, for ſo Brave an Effort on the Behalf of <hi>our Diſtreſſed Mother.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed ſhe was under very deplorable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: For tho her <hi>Doctrines</hi> ſtood firm as a <hi>Rock</hi> (for <hi>thereon</hi> They are grounded) and She enjoyed not only <hi>Publique Liberty</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> but all the Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues to boot, yet, alas! She was diſarm'd of her Thunderbolts; Her dear <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicato Capiendo</hi>'s, her ſweet <hi>Twenty Pound per Month</hi> Penalties, her pretious <hi>Thirty-Fifth of Elizabeth,</hi> and the like Weapons of her <hi>Spiritual Warfare,</hi> were all wreſted out of her Hands, or render'd Uſeleſs: <hi>Toleration Diſcuſs'd</hi> to her vaſt diſadvantage; The <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Seperation</hi> prov'd to proceed from the <hi>Miſchief of Impoſitions:</hi> And not a <hi>Man of Senſe</hi> that would appear on her behalf for the Reſtitution of this <hi>Bleſſed Artillery.</hi> For thoſe Mighty Champions and well-paid <hi>Penſioners,</hi> who ſwagger'd ſo high for her in days of Yore, had <hi>no more Ink</hi> at her Service, when once the <hi>Golden Current was dry'd up;</hi> but remain Retir'd and Silent, as <hi>Owls</hi> at <hi>Noon;</hi> and like Treacherous <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> having Exhauſted their Clients Purſe in a tedious <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary Brangle,</hi> deſert her, when reduc'd (by their own Ill-management) to Sue in <hi>Forma Pauperis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Extremity, you, Madam! are the <hi>Pucelle de Dieu,</hi> that <hi>Joan of Arque,</hi> who ſtept in to Retrieve our Forlorn Affairs, and body up our Sinking Reputation; You
<pb facs="tcp:47993:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>are the brave <hi>Semiramis</hi> that muſt Rebuild the Walls of our <hi>Babel;</hi> You have ſatisfied all the World by undeniable Demonſtrations, That our Church has <hi>its Enthuſiaſts</hi> too, as well as the <hi>Rankeſt</hi> Phanaticks: And tho you could not (as you Gravely tell us) obtain to be the <hi>City</hi>'s, you ſhall have our Vote to be the <hi>Churches God-Mother;</hi> and to <hi>Faſt</hi> too (if you pleaſe, ſince you have got ſo rare a <hi>Knack</hi> at it) for all our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Clergy;</hi> becauſe that <hi>Meager Exerciſe</hi> may not, perhaps, agree very kindly with many of their Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>We cannot but with equal <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> obſerve how wonderouſly you have Edified the <hi>Tripe-Women,</hi> and Convinc'd the <hi>Porters,</hi> That <hi>our Church is the only Church for Loyalty;</hi> and that <hi>you your ſelf</hi> (how light ſoever) <hi>can Weigh down all the reſt,</hi> in that excellent Qualification. The truth is, whilſt the Government takes our Meaſures, and advances our Intereſt, we can be very Loyal; huge <hi>good Subjects,</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of Prerogative, as long as we are pleas'd; But if our Purpoſes be croſs'd, and Affairs happen to go againſt the grain of our Humour, we can be as Peeviſh as our Neighbours, drop the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> and leave <hi>Non Reſistance</hi> to ſhift for it ſelf; prove as apt as any to murmur and look <hi>bowdy;</hi> as full of Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies (the Swadling-Clouts of Sedition) as the Tribe of <hi>Forty One</hi> it ſelf; As loud in Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours at the Miniſters of State, as buſie in Squinting Reflections to miſ-repreſent our Superiors Actions and Intentions, as ready to lick up the Abominated Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> Capacity, and to ſet the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> at Daggers-drawing againſt each other.</p>
            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, we have your Word for't, That our Church of <hi>England</hi> (that is, as you Wittily define it, <hi>p.</hi> 7. Thoſe <hi>that are for Common-Prayer</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi>) deſires <hi>Nothing Elſe <hi>but to ſerve God Truly, and the King Rightly;</hi>
               </hi> and we Rejoyce we have ſuch an Authentick Evidence in the caſe; for elſe the People would ſuſpect, it was rather, To <hi>hold our Benefices, Domineer over our Neighbours, and Ruin all that will not Truckle to our Inventions.</hi> You have <hi>aſſerted</hi> (which amongſt Friends paſſes as well as if you had <hi>prov'd</hi> it) That <hi>all the World</hi> (you might decently have Excepted <hi>ſome few,</hi> that may happen to be of your <hi>Soveraign</hi>'s <hi>contrary</hi> Opinion) knows, <hi>That they that are for Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>Never had any Loialty.</hi>
               </hi> A bold Stroke! which beſides a very courſe Complement on his <hi>Majesty,</hi> Brands the <hi>Bulk</hi> of the Nation for <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traitors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all theſe your Great and <hi>Heroick</hi> Atchievements, you may juſtly expect our Grateful Acknowledgments, and eſpecially for your moſt Orthodox <hi>Hopes,</hi> That the <hi>King will not ſatisfy His Own</hi> (and the far greater part of His Subjects) <hi>Deſires, by removing the <hi>Teſt</hi> and the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> but let them ſtand as Rods do upon Mantil-trees, to keep Rebellious Children in Subjection.</hi> A brave Expedient to continue our Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and feed our Hopes of getting Power once again, to worry our Honeſt <hi>Peaceable Fellow-Subjects!</hi> Of whom, even of <hi>Protestant Diſſenters,</hi> by a Modeſt Calculation, we have (thanks to thoſe Excellent Statutes of our own Procurement) occaſioned the untimely <hi>Death</hi> of above <hi>Three-thouſand Perſons,</hi> by their Impriſonment in Noiſome Jails, and Ruin'd more than <hi>Threeſcore-thouſand Families,</hi> within 25 years by paſt; And all this on the Score of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformity</hi> to Ceremonies, which we our ſelves own'd to be <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſtill we are not without good hopes that your Notable Paper, in Conjunction with our ſtrenuous Endeavours (which are much of the <hi>ſame ſize,</hi> both for Logick and Politicks) may cajole the Eaſie <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to abandon their Intereſt and <hi>Only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative,</hi> at this Critical Juncture; And ſuffer their Actions to give the Lye to all their <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> by <hi>HERDING</hi> with our Party, to Continue thoſe very <hi>Plagues,</hi> which they have ſo ſeverely Smarted under, and loudly Complained of. In Requital whereof, we are reſolved on the firſt Opportunity to Scourge them more <hi>Canonically</hi> then ever, That they may learn by Experience the Truth of that Proverb, <hi>The Rod is Reſerved for the Back of Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, for theſe, and the reſt of your alike <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> Suggeſtions, we cannot but return you our moſt <hi>Humble and Hearty Thanks, as becomes the Modern True Sons of the Church of</hi> England;</p>
